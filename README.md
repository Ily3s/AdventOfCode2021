# AdventOfCode2021

This is my repo of [AdventOfCode2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions written in C++

Each folder contains a Dayx.cpp file that meant to be compiling singlely (and contains a main function, so it can compile into an executable).
Each folder contains an input.txt file with my puzzle input and an example.txt file with the example.
Then you can replace my puzzle input by yours in the input.txt file.

At the beggining of each .cpp file, there will be a PART macro and eventually an EXAMPLE macro.
Then you have to define the PART macro as being 1 if you want the executable to output part 1 or as 2 if you want the part 2.
You can as well define the EXAMPLE macro as being 1 if you want the executable to take as input the example.txt file
or as 0 if you want it to take as input the input.txt file


## Why I didn't save Christmas

* Because puzzles 18 to 24 have been sooo hard
* Beacause my motivation is more ephemeral than an r-value

I ended this AoC with 43/50 stars which is not so bad.
Merry Christmas to those who celebrate it,
Happy New Year
